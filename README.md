## Features

- **Multi-language Code Editor**: Write and execute code in Python, C, C++, and Java.
- **Code Compilation and Execution**: Compile and run code in an isolated Docker environment.
- **Contest Management**: Participate in coding contests with problem statements and submissions.
- **User Profile**: Track progress and achievements.

## Getting Started

To get started with Zenovation-CodeCraft, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Python
- Streamlit
- MongoDB (for backend data management)
- Additional dependencies: `streamlit_ace`, `streamlit_navigation_bar`, `pymongo`

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Zenovation-CodeCraft
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit streamlit_ace streamlit_navigation_bar pymongo
   ```
3. **Run the Application**
   Start the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Docker Integration

## Overview

Zenovation-CodeCraft leverages Docker to provide a secure and scalable environment for code execution. The platform is built on Streamlit, with MongoDB Atlas serving as the backend. When users submit code on the website, it is sent to a Docker container running an Ubuntu instance. This container, equipped with the necessary compilers and interpreters for C, C++, Python, and Java, ensures that the code is executed in a completely isolated environment.

## Key Features of Docker Integration
   - Isolation: Each container provides an isolated environment, preventing conflicts between different versions of dependencies.
   - Consistency: The same environment is used for every build, ensuring consistent results.
   - Reproducibility: Docker images can be versioned and shared, making it easy to reproduce the environment and compile code in the exact same setup.

## Docker Setup

1. **Creating an Ubuntu Docker Image**
   An Ubuntu Docker image was created to serve as the base environment for compiling and running code. Hereâ€™s how it was done:
   - Dockerfile Creation: A Dockerfile was created to define the environment. This file specifies the base image (Ubuntu) and includes commands to install necessary dependencies and tools for code compilation.
   ```bash
   FROM ubuntu:latest
   ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
   RUN apt-get update && \
       apt-get install -y \
       build-essential \
       gcc \
       g++ \
       openjdk-11-jdk \
       python3 \
       python3-pip \
       && apt-get clean
   WORKDIR /app
   ```
   - Building the Docker Image: The Docker image was built using the following command:
     
   ```bash
   docker build -t ubuntu-dev-env .
   ```
   This command creates an image named ubuntu-dev-env based on the Dockerfile.

2. **Running the Docker Container**
   Once the image was built, a Docker container was created and started from this image. The container provides an isolated environment where code can be compiled and executed.
   ```bash
   docker run -it --name code-compilation-container ubuntu-dev-env
   ```
